### Introduction:

- The purpose of the application is to display the information about the current weather conditions of a city (the city entered by the user).
For this purpose, the mentioned information should be received from https://www.weatherapi.com/ by the API and then displayed to the user.

### Design and Implementation:

- First, the class named "WeatherInfo" is created. Then the output type of "getWeatherData" method is converted from "String" to "Object" to make it easier to work with. Then the GUI is added to the application by Java Swing.
To make the wind speed more readable, a method named "getCompleteDirectionName" is created to show the wind speed in a readable way to the user.



### Testing and Evaluation:

- First, some cities were entered with the correct name and the application worked properly.
But in two scenarios, the application didn't work:
1. Some random names entered
2. Internet disconnected

### Conclusion:

- In this project, I experienced the use of the API practically.
- OOP helped me a lot to get the result and also enhanced the readability of my code.
- Unfortunately, one of the weaknesses of my code is exception handling.
